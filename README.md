# Webcam GUI: A Python Tutorial

This repository is an example on how to build a GUI using Python and PyQt5. The examples are based on acquiring data with a webcam through OpenCV. As time passes, this repository is going to become more complete and will serve as a guide for anybody who wants to give his/her first steps into developing desktop applications with Python. 

Each Chapter will be correlated to a tag in this repository. This will make it easy to compare what you are doing on your own with what it is supposed to be. In this case, if any problem appears, you can compare with the original code, without jumping ahead. 

List of chapters and their status:

- [ ] Create a Virtual Environment and a Repository
- [ ] Getting Started: Install OpenCV, Numpy, and Matplotlib
- [ ] Structuring the Project: The MVC pattern
- [ ] Developing a Model for the Camera and a Dummy model
- [ ] Developing a Model for the Experiment
- [ ] Using Threads to interact with the Experiment
- [ ] Starting with PyQt5: Buttons, Signals and Slots
- [ ] Displaying a video: Introduction to PyQtGraph
- [ ] Using QThreads to keep the GUI Responsive
- [ ] Saving Data using HDF5
- [ ] Making a Redistributable Package
- [ ] Building Documentation
- [ ] Adding Tests
- [ ] Adding TravisCI to Check the Code

### Optional Chapters
- [ ] Adding Mouse Interaction

- [ ] Real-time data analysis: Face Detection
- [ ] Controlling the camera through the network
- [ ] Open to suggestions

## Skills you are going to learn

By following the tutorial you are going to learn a lot of different skills that will allow you to develop software with confidence. We are going to start from scratch and build our way to a fully functional User Interface that will allow you to acquire data from a webcam. 

The skills that you need to develop in order to succeed will help you to understand from the basics of programming with Python to advanced topics such as *threading*, *network communication*, and *exception handling*. Even if every chapter builds on the previous one, most of the contents can be used independently as a reference on the topic at hand.
 
 To summarize some of the topics you are going to see in this course:

* Proper programming workflow for Python projects. We will start by creating a **virtual environment** and a **Git repository** to keep track of our progress and changes. 
* You will learn how to install and **manage dependencies** in Python.
* We will review how and when to use **classes** to make your code more reusable and understandable. 
* **Numpy** will be the package of choice to deal with numerical data, together with **scipy** and **matplotlib** to make plots.
* You will learn how to **communicate with a device** such as a digital camera.
* I will explain what the **Model-View-Controller** design pattern is and how you can use it in projects which interact with real-world devices.
* We will cover how to **handle exceptions** in order to give the future users of our code flexibility and clarity.
* You will learn how to structure your code into **a package** that can be easily shared and installed. 
* We are going to discuss about **documentation** and how to build it using **Sphinx** and sharing it thanks to Read The Docs.
* **Testing** is a crucial part of any program, and automated tests are a great tool to develop with confidence.
* **Continuous Integration** tools allow you to automatize a lot of your work. We are going to see how TravisCI can help you in your projects. 
* **Threading** is a crucial part of any program that needs to remain responsive and ready to receive user input at any stage. 
* We are going to **analyze data** with numpy and scipy. 
* Building **Graphical User Interfaces** with Python is not that complicated. Learn from a realistic approach, using **PyQt5**.
* Validate user input with the use of **decorators** to avoid going out of range.
* Learn how to use **yaml** files to store configuration information and metadata of your experiments.
* And many, many more interesting subjects.
