# Webcam GUI: A Python Tutorial

This repository is an example on how to build a GUI using Python and PyQt5. The examples are based on acquiring data with a webcam through OpenCV. As time passes, this repository is going to become more complete and will serve as a guide for anybody who wants to give his/her first steps into developing desktop applications with Python. 

Each Chapter will be correlated to a tag in this repository. This will make it easy to compare what you are doing on your own with what it is supposed to be. In this case, if any problem appears, you can compare with the original code, without jumping ahead.
